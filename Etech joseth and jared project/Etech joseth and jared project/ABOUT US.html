        <h3 class="title">OUR GOAL AND WHY WE CREATED THIS SHOP</h3>
        
          <h6><p>These days new consoles are more popular and more common to see, examples of these are PLAYSTATION 5 (PS5) AND XBOX 360, and you don't get to see some old consoles being sold from other game shops
          </p></h6>
          <h6><p>Not just consoles but also video games, these days its rare to find someone playing an old video game, majority of games these days are new types of games and are difficult to play, with confusing game mechanics but good story to it, unlike before its as simple as jumping up and down collecting coins as sonic or exploring racoon city and finding a way to defeat different kinds of monsters and zombies in resident evil. </p></h6>
          <h6><p>So here in OLD SCHOOL GAMING our goal in this page is to be able to show old players the feeling of nostalgia whenever they see or they use an old console and old games, 
            and for new players to be able to feel what its like to play an old consoles and old games.</p></h6>
